## Tic Tac Toe

This game is develop to be player for tow person, is responsive and allow you to reset and play in a new board or finish the current game and play again.

## Technologies that I used

To develop this project I used **vanilla JavaScript**, **CSS** and **HTML** as I considered the scope of the project was appropriate

## Challenges that I faced

Understanding how I have to organize the data was difficult and I think I still don't quite understand how to separate the data and the Dom.

## Features, that i want to implement in the future

I would like to have a **scoreboard** and I would like people to be able to play on different devices.
